Here are the security improvements made in this version:

Helmet Middleware: The helmet middleware is added to enhance security by setting various HTTP headers related to security measures, such as enabling appropriate Content Security Policies (CSP), XSS protection, and more. This helps protect the application against common web vulnerabilities.

Rate Limiting: The express-rate-limit middleware is included to limit the number of requests from a single IP address within a specified time window. This helps mitigate DoS attacks and limits abuse by controlling the request rate.

Secure Flag Value: Instead of reading the flag from a file, a placeholder value ('***********') is used. In a production environment, you should store the flag securely, such as in environment variables or a secure database. Retrieve the flag from the secure storage as needed.

User IP Extraction: The code now retrieves the user's IP address using req.ip, which is a safer and more reliable method provided by Express.

Error Handling: Error handling is not explicitly shown in the code provided, but it's essential to implement appropriate error handling throughout the application. Wrap file reading operations and other potential sources of errors in try-catch blocks, and return meaningful error responses to the client.
